This site is a website I create to see where I am as far as design and layout. It is primarily to showcase my what I know how to do in HTML and CSS which is why at this time there is no content on this site even though you can navigate through the various pages.

The goal is as a continue on this journey to improve upon my skills, this will be one project I will build upon within the next few months.  
Future additions to this site will include: 
  - Update to follow current SEO guidelines
  - Add more generic content to make site look more realistic 
  - Make changes to CSS so  site is more responsive when dealing with different screensizes
